# Desktop-Clock
Desktop Clock is a lightweight and clean utility built with Python and Tkinter. Designed to be both simple and highly customizable, it runs in a borderless, transparent window that acts more like a desktop overlay than a traditional application.

The app displays the current time in large, crisp text with an optional date displayed underneath. You have complete control over the font family, size, and alignment, as well as the size ratio between the time and date. All changes are applied instantly, allowing you to see your edits without restarting the app.

Interaction is intuitive: you can move the clock anywhere on your screen simply by clicking and dragging the text. A right-click opens a context menu that lets you browse system fonts via a built-in search tool, adjust the time size, or open a dedicated date settings panel.

The date settings allow you to toggle the date on or off, change its alignment, and switch between English, Turkish, and a Turkish (Safe) mode for better font compatibility. The app dynamically resizes its window based on your settings while keeping its position stable, ensuring a smooth experience while personalizing your view.

Optimized for macOS, Desktop Clock hides its dock icon to stay out of your way and behaves like a native background utility. Because it only updates every few seconds, it uses minimal system resources, remaining a practical and visually elegant addition to any workspace.
